# LoneCodeGuardian - AI Code Review GitHub Action

A GitHub Action that performs automated code reviews on pull requests using AI models from Anthropic (Claude) or Google (Gemini).

## Features

- ü§ñ Automated code review for pull requests
- üîç Identifies bugs, logic errors, security issues, and typos
- üß† Powered by state-of-the-art AI models (Claude or Gemini)
- üí¨ Adds specific, actionable comments directly to the code
- üìä Provides a summary of the review
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable to include/exclude specific file types or paths
- üîÑ Supports incremental reviews

## Local Development and Testing

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed
- API keys for the AI providers you want to use (Anthropic and/or Google)

### GitHub Actions for Testing

This repository includes several GitHub Actions workflows to help test and validate the action:

1. **Self Code Review** - Automatically runs the AI code review action on pull requests to this repository.
   - Triggered when PRs are opened, synchronized, or reopened
   - Uses the Anthropic provider by default
   - Requires the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret to be set in the repository

2. **Test Action** - Allows manual testing of the action on specific PRs.
   - Can be triggered manually with a PR number
   - Also runs automatically every day at midnight on the latest PR
   - Useful for testing changes to the action

3. **Test Suite** - Runs the test suite to ensure the action is working correctly.
   - Triggered on pushes to main/master and on pull requests
   - Runs the test suite and verifies the build

To use these workflows, you need to:

1. Set up the required secrets in your repository:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key (for Claude)
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Your Google API key (if using Gemini)

2. For manual testing, go to the "Actions" tab, select "Test AI Code Review Action", and click "Run workflow". Enter the PR number you want to review.

For detailed setup instructions, see [GitHub Actions Setup Guide](docs/github-actions-setup.md).

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoneCodeGuardian.git
   cd LoneCodeGuardian
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

### Running Tests

Bun has a built-in test runner that we use for testing. You can run the tests in several ways:

#### Run All Tests

```bash
bun test
```

#### Run Specific Test Files

```bash
bun test test/schema.test.ts
bun test test/review-schema.test.ts
bun test test/input-processor.test.ts
```

#### Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
bun test --coverage
```

#### Run Tests in Watch Mode

```bash
bun test --watch
```

### Local Testing with Mock Data

To run a simulated GitHub Action environment with mock data:

```bash
bun run test:local
```

This will:
1. Load environment variables from your `.env` file
2. Mock the GitHub API and Action inputs
3. Run through the entire code review process
4. Display the review summary

### Testing with Real Data

To test with real data, you can modify the `test/mocks.ts` file to include real file content and changed files from a pull request.

## Configuration

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `token` | GitHub token (optional, automatically provided by GitHub Actions when permissions are set) | No | - |
| `owner` | Repository owner | Yes | - |
| `repo` | Repository name | Yes | - |
| `pr_number` | Pull request number | Yes | - |
| `ai_provider` | AI provider to use (anthropic or google) | Yes | `anthropic` |
| `anthropic_api_key` | Anthropic API key (required if using Anthropic provider) | No | - |
| `anthropic_model` | Anthropic model name | No | `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` |
| `google_api_key` | Google AI API key (required if using Google provider) | No | - |
| `google_model` | Google model name | No | `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| `include_extensions` | File extensions to include in the review (comma-separated, e.g., ".js,.ts,.py") | No | - |
| `exclude_extensions` | File extensions to exclude from the review (comma-separated) | No | - |
| `include_paths` | Paths to include in the review (comma-separated) | No | - |
| `exclude_paths` | Paths to exclude from review (comma-separated, e.g., "test/,docs/") | No | - |
| `fail_action_if_review_failed` | If set to true, the action fails when the review process fails | No | `false` |

Note: While the GitHub token is automatically provided to the action based on the job's permissions configuration, it's recommended to explicitly pass it as `token: ${{ github.token }}` to ensure it's properly accessible to the action.

## Example Usage

```yaml
name: AI Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  ai-code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Required permissions for the action to work
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: AI Code Review
        uses: your-username/LoneCodeGuardian@main
        with:
          token: ${{ github.token }}
          repo: ${{ github.repository_name }}
          owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          ai_provider: anthropic
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          anthropic_model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229
          include_extensions: .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx
          exclude_extensions: .test.ts,.spec.ts
          include_paths: src/
          exclude_paths: node_modules/,dist/
```

Note: It's important to explicitly pass the GitHub token as `token: ${{ github.token }}` to ensure it's properly accessible to the action, even though the permissions are set at the job level.

## How It Works

1. The action retrieves the changed files in the pull request
2. It filters the files based on the configured include/exclude patterns
3. The AI model analyzes the code and identifies issues
4. The action adds comments directly to the pull request
5. A summary of the review is added as a comment on the pull request
